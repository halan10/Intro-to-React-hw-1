    name: "Madonna Litta",
    description:
      "The work was written for the rulers of Milan, then passed to the Litt family, and was in their private collection for several centuries. The original title of the painting is Madonna and Child. The modern name of the painting comes from the name of its owner, Count Litta, who also owned the family art gallery in Milan. In 1864, he approached the Hermitage with an offer to buy Madonna and Child and several other paintings. In 1865, the Hermitage purchased four paintings from the count, among which was Madonna and Child, for 100,000 francs.",
